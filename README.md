Generate a Rails app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users.

Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. First name is required. Email should be a valid email. 

Deploy this app to Heroku (a free *.herokuapp.com URL) so we can test it out live.
